## NOTE:
There should be three branches in GitHub when you are complete. Branching is an important concept that is worth the time to learn. You have seen several demos of my branches and how easy it is to preserve the state of the source code and easy it is to navigate between branches. Get active on Piazza if you do not understand the branching part. Remember, you can also do all this on the command line that is available in Android Studio.
